### How to contribute
Follow these steps if you want to contribute to this project:
- Fork the repository. Open your terminal and clone the forked repo locally.
- Navigate to the folder and open in your text editor
- On your terminal, set upstream branch:
  ```js
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/auth_wiki_team_10.git
  ```
- Pull upstream: `git pull upstream dev`
- Create a branch for the feauture you're working on `git checkout -b <feature-name>`
- After making changes, stage all the changes you have made locally for a commit by running `git add <file-names>`
- Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message `git commit -m "your commit message"`
- Before you push to your changes always make sure that your branch is always up-to-date in other to avoid merge conflicts: `git pull upstream dev`
- After making sure your branch is up-to-date, push the new changes to your new branch: `git push origin <your-current-branch-name>`
- Create a pull request to the dev branch
- ***DO NOT*** merge your PRs. They'll be reviewed and merged.

### Server (backend) Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to setup and run server:
- In the root directory of this project, create a virtual environment 
  ```js
    python -m venv my-env
  ```
- Activate the just created virtual environment (I'll recommend you run this code in a Git bash terminal. It won't work on windows) 
  ```js
    source my-env/Scripts/activate
  ```
- Make a copy of the `.env examples` file found in the `config` directory. Rename that copy to `.env`. That's where you'd put all future environment variable/configs
- Install all packages
  ```js
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Download and install (MongoDB)[https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community].
- Download (MongoDB Compass)[https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass].
- If you're confused at this point, please checkout (this tutorial on how to download and setup Mongodb)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMwO8pXfq0]
- Watch this tutorial on (how to install and setup MongoDB Compass)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXCcLAi5aU]
- Then create a mongoDB database locally called `auth_wiki`.
- Run migrations `python manage.py migrate`.
- Run server `python manage.py runserver`.
- ***NOTE:*** Whenever you install a new package to the project run 
  ```js
    pip freeze --local requirements.txt
  ```
